## Books

I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mattyj612" target="_blank"> 42 books this year! </a>
Audiobooks have totally changed my life. In undergrad, I never read for pleasure during the
semester, but now I'm reading (i.e. listening) constantly. Doing the dishes,
folding laundry, walking to class, exercising; these are mere subsidiary tasks
that facilitate more audiobook consumption.

#### **1\. Richard Rhodes -- The Making of the Atomic Bomb (1986)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/atomic_bomb.jpg" title="atomic bomb">

Undoubtedly one of the most important and awe-inspiring books I've ever read.
It's been called "an epic worthy of Milton" and I agree. It paints intimate portraits
of Rutherford, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Szilard, and other scientists who, spurred only
by a drive to understand the universe and propelled by the largest conflict in history,
built something frightening. The specificity is bonkers and personalities shine through
on every page. We learn about Einstein's ripped pecs, Fermi's dancing prowess, Bohr's
two-at-a-time stair hopping, Oppenheimer's acting skills, and the temperament of
everyone involved in the decision to drop the bomb. I also learned tons about geopolitics.
After writing to President Roosevelt to warn of the possibility of an atomic bomb,
Einstein also contacted the queen of Belgium, because the world's largest store of
uranium was located in Belgian-controlled Congo. It's also a freaking enthralling
page-turner (or, in my case, no-pauser). It's at once a comedy (Schrödinger gets
sick at Bohr's house but Bohr refuses to stop grilling him about quantum mechanics), and
a profound tragedy (diary entries from children who survived Hiroshima).

I now feel like this is one of the most important stories in human history. When
learning about WWII, the Nazis get the most airtime. That's kinda silly. There was
a whole other war going on in the Pacific, with its own gigantic historical and
ethical complexities. If you like physics, 20th century history, warfare, long
strings of adjectives, or sparkling and cinematic narrative prose, then this
hugely concequential epic is a must-read.

#### **2\. David Deutsch -- The Beginning of Infinity (2011)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/deutsch.jpg" title="beginning of infinity">

*The Beginning of Infinity* was a paradigm-shifting book for me. Deutsch systematically
dismantles myths about science and philosophy, and erects in their place a truly
novel and mind-expanding framework. Here's my best attempt at a summary.

Stable and lasting progress arises from the search for **good explanations**. A good
explanation must be **hard to vary**, in the sense that slightly altering any of
its assumptions would dramatically alter its predictions. Good Explanations have
**universal reach**, since they can be used to understand things we might never
see. General relativiy and quantum mechanics allow us to reason about black holes
and the big bang, while natural selection allows us to think about extinct species
from millions of years ago. Explanations improve by conjecture and refutation: when
a new theory is proposed, we can use evidence to knock it down---whichever theory
withstands the most criticism is our best guess at the truth, until something better
comes along. The search for good explanations is never over, since there will always
be new scientific problems to solve. Solutions to problems give rise to new problems,
which must be solved in turn. That is: problems are inevitable, but problems are solvable,
provided we have the right knowledge. We are therefore always at the beginning of an
infinite process of knowledge creation.

This chain of reasoning leads to this potentially obvious but nevertheless astounding
claim: Everything that is not forbidden by the laws of nature is achievable, given the
right knowledge. (Take that in!!)

We are often told two contradictory facts about our place in the universe:

  1. Humans are mere chemical scum, on a typical planet, in a typical galaxy
  2. The universe is perfectly fine-tuned for our existence

So, which is it? Are we special, or not? The second idea is false because it's like
claiming that English is perfectly fine-tuned for the works of Shakespeare. We evolved
to suit the conditions of our universe, now look back and say "wow, can you believe
the universe is perfectly suited for us?" The whole story is backwards.

The first idea is false because humans (i.e. "chemical scum") are incredibly atypical.
Our planet contains configurations of matter that don't exist anywhere else in the
universe (skyscrapers, birthday cakes, thumbs), and more importantly, we are the only
thing in the universe that is capable of generating representations of other parts
of the unvierse. We can simulate in our minds or on our computers the full goings-on of
a quasar millions of light-years away.

These are merely the high-level takeaways from a very dense and totally epic book. I
just finished reading Deutsch's first book, *The Fabric of Reality*, and it's equally awesome.

#### **3\. Rebecca Skloot -- The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (2010)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/henrietta.jpg" title="henrietta lacks">

Going in, I knew that *The Immortal Life Henrietta Lacks* would be a straightforward
biography of Henrietta Lacks, whose infinitely-reproducing cancer cells were taken
without concent and used for medical research, without any compensation to Henrietta
or her family. I knew that it would be an important and tragic story about race, class,
science, and medicine. What I didn't realize was that this book is written in a
beautiful inter-woven time-travelling style that masterfully jumps between three
narrative strands: the history of cancer research and medical ethics, the story of
Henrietta Lacks and her family in 1950s Baltimore, and the buddy-cop road trip tale
of Rebecca Skloot (the author) and Deborah Lacks (Henrietta's daughter). The beautiful
narrative combined with the unfathomably meticulous research---Skloot was able to
recreate the exact conditions of the day Henrietta discovered her tumor in 1951,
down to the weather and color of the walls---makes this a serious feat of journalism
and scientific writing.

The most important thing about this book, though, is that it's made Henrietta's
story an integral part of the science education curriculum. No lesson on cancer is
complete without a discussion of the fraught history of medical research and a serious
reflection on bioethics.

#### **4\. Will & Ariel Durant -- The Lessons of Hisory (1968)**

Two historians reflect on a lifetime of studying the past. The lessons of 100
centuries distilled into 100 pages. Every paragraph is bursting with aphorisms,
many of which are dated, but all of which are insightful.

<!-- Some of my favorite quotes: -->

<!-- <blockquote>
Our worst vices might be remnants from out rise, rather than signs of our decline.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
An excess of order is order; an excess of liberty is chaos.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Shakespeare is immortal only between ice ages.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Economic history is the repeated cystoly and diastole of wealth accumulation by the
rich then redistribution, either peacefully or by revolution. The upper classes hissed,
sighed, then resumed concentrating wealth.
</blockquote> -->

One key takeaway lesson for me is that almost all modern-day problems and debates
have some analogue in the past. Wealth inequality, technological change, political
turmoil, populism, imperialism, colonialism, socialism, capitalism: none of these
are the least bit new. Be very, *very* skeptical any time anyone says anything is
"unprecedented." Chances are, they haven't looked hard enough into history, the
source of unbelievably more precedent than you can imagine.

A final point *The Lessons of History* makes excellently is that, aside from improvements
in the material conditions of life (health, nourishment, etc.), each successive
generation is better off because they have more of the lineage of human history
to reflect on. There is more art, music, science, history, and philosophy available
for consumption and contemplation today than ever before, and this is true of
every generation to follow.

Incidentally, Chance the Rapper makes the exact same point in a commencement address
he gave earlier this year.

James Brown was revolutionary, but he lacked for inspiration
something that we now have: the music of James Brown. Michael Jackson had James
Brown, but didn't have Michael Jackson. Beyoncé had Michael Jackson, but also
experienced the unthinkable: a childhood void of the music of Beyoncé. We get Beyoncé,
and can continue to build on top of this massive cultural legacy. I find that to
be pretty dang inspiring.

#### **5\. Atul Gawande -- Being Mortal (2014)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/being_mortal.jpg" title="being mortal">

When treating aging and dying patients, doctors are too focused on extending life,
at the expense of enhancing and enriching it. The end of life should be dignified
and meaningful, not isolating and dispiriting. Paradoxically, when doctors themselves
become terminally ill, they reject the standard procedures, opting instead to live
out their final days in comfort in hospice care, rather than stuck in a hospital
bed...and then end up living longer anyway! An eye-opening, must-read book.

#### **6\. Kate Manne -- Down Girl (2017)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/down_girl.jpg" title="down girl">

This is a dense, technically rigorous, meticulously argued philosophical treatise
on misogyny. I learned a great deal. Manne argues that misogyny is not about men's
hatred of women, per se, but rather about the attitudes and societal structures
that keep women in a subservient position. Contrary to popular belief, men don't
seek to deprive women of their humanity or personhood. The logic of misogyny
is that women's humanity ought to be directed to the service of men.

There is a broader point here: when one group oppresses another, whether it be
in the context of patriarchy, slavery, or genocide, it is not because
they view the oppressed group as sub-human. You wouldn't be concerned if a sub-human
entity shamed, humiliated, or betrayed you, nor would you seek to objectify, punish,
or dominate them. As Manne says: "it's not a sense of a woman's humanity that is
lacking. Her humanity is precisely the problem."

For a brilliant summary, check out <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-root-of-all-cruelty"
target="_blank">this article from the psychologist Paul Bloom</a>, which is where I first heard about the book. *Down Girl*
is a must read, especially for men, in order to understand social forces that we
can't see, and often unknowingly perpetuate.

#### **7\. David Kaiser -- How The Hippies Saved Physics (2011)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/hippies.jpg" title="how the hippies saved physics">

#### **8\. Will Durant -- The Story of Philosophy (1924)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/philosophy.jpg" title="the story of philosophy">

#### **9\. Steve Martin -- Born Standing Up (2007)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/steve_martin.jpg" title="born standing up">

It's a dang shame that Steve Martin's early comedy is relegated to the archives
of stand-up history, because it's still unbelievably funny. Listen, in full, to
this song, from 1977. It feels absolutely timeless.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMAXuZOw_DY"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
allowfullscreen></iframe>

If *Born Standing Up* makes anything clear, it's that Steve Martin worked his
tuchus off to get to where he is. Becoming a successful comedian requres years
and years of toil without recognition, dozens of bombed shows, countless hours
of workshopping material, and a refusal to ever become complacent. Only then can
you craft one-liners like these:

<blockquote>New research suggests that more Americans watch television than any
other appliance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I’ve been your friend for a while, and I think I can ask you this
question: What time is it?</blockquote>

The book is read by Steve Martin himself, and hearing his old material in his own
voice is such a treat.
