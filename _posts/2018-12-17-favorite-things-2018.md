I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mattyj612" target="_blank"> 42 books this year! </a>
Audiobooks have totally changed my life. In undergrad, I never read for pleasure during the
semester, but now I'm reading (i.e. listening) constantly. Doing the dishes,
folding laundry, walking to class, exercising; these are mere subsidiary tasks
that facilitate more audiobook consumption.

#### **1\. Richard Rhodes &ndash; The Making of the Atomic Bomb (1986)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/atomic_bomb.jpg" title="atomic bomb">

Undoubtedly one of the most important and awe-inspiring books I've ever read.
It's been called "an epic worthy of Milton" and I agree. It paints intimate portraits
of Rutherford, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Szilard, and other scientists who, spurred only
by a drive to understand the universe and propelled by the largest conflict in history,
built something frightening. The specificity is bonkers and personalities shine through
on every page. We learn about Einstein's ripped pecs, Fermi's dancing prowess, Bohr's
two-at-a-time stair hopping, Oppenheimer's acting skills, and the temperament of
everyone involved in the decision to drop the bomb. I also learned tons about geopolitics.
After writing to President Roosevelt to warn of the possibility of an atomic bomb,
Einstein also contacted the queen of Belgium, because the world's largest store of
uranium was located in Belgian-controlled Congo. It's also a freaking enthralling
page-turner (or, in my case, no-pauser). It's at once a comedy (Schrödinger gets
sick at Bohr's house but Bohr refuses to stop grilling him about quantum mechanics), and
a profound tragedy (diary entries from children who survived Hiroshima).

I now feel like this is one of the most important stories in human history. When
learning about WWII, the Nazis get the most airtime. That's kinda silly. There was
a whole other war going on in the Pacific, with its own gigantic historical and
ethical complexities. If you like physics, 20th century history, warfare, long
strings of adjectives, or sparkling and cinematic narrative prose, then this
hugely consequential tome is unmissable.

#### **2\. David Deutsch &ndash; The Beginning of Infinity (2011)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/deutsch.jpg" title="beginning of infinity">

*The Beginning of Infinity* was a paradigm-shifting book for me. Deutsch systematically
dismantles myths about science and philosophy, and erects in their place a truly
novel and mind-expanding framework. Here's my best attempt at a summary.

Stable and lasting progress arises from the search for **good explanations**. A good
explanation must be **hard to vary**, in the sense that slightly altering any of
its assumptions would dramatically alter its predictions. Good Explanations have
**universal reach**, since they can be used to understand things we might never
see. General relativity and quantum mechanics allow us to reason about black holes
and the big bang, while natural selection allows us to think about extinct species
from millions of years ago. Explanations improve by conjecture and refutation: when
a new theory is proposed, we can use evidence to knock it down&emdash;whichever theory
withstands the most criticism is our best guess at the truth, until something better
comes along. The search for good explanations is never over, since there will always
be new scientific problems to solve. Solutions to problems give rise to new problems,
which must be solved in turn. That is: problems are inevitable, but problems are solvable,
provided we have the right knowledge. We are therefore always at the beginning of an
infinite process of knowledge creation.

This chain of reasoning leads to this potentially obvious but nevertheless astounding
claim: Everything that is not forbidden by the laws of nature is achievable, given the
right knowledge. (Take that in!!)

We are often told two contradictory facts about our place in the universe:

  1. Humans are mere chemical scum, on a typical planet, in a typical galaxy
  2. The universe is perfectly fine-tuned for our existence

So, which is it? Are we special, or not? The second idea is false because it's like
claiming that English is perfectly fine-tuned for the works of Shakespeare. We evolved
to suit the conditions of our universe, now look back and say "wow, can you believe
the universe is perfectly suited for us?" The whole story is backwards.

The first idea is false because humans (i.e. "chemical scum") are incredibly atypical.
Our planet contains configurations of matter that don't exist anywhere else in the
universe (skyscrapers, birthday cakes, thumbs), and more importantly, we are the only
thing in the universe that is capable of generating representations of other parts
of the universe. We can simulate in our minds or on our computers the full goings-on of
a quasar millions of light-years away.

These are merely the high-level takeaways from a very dense and totally thought-provoking
book. I just finished reading Deutsch's first book, *The Fabric of Reality*, and it's equally awesome.

#### **3\. Rebecca Skloot &ndash; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (2010)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/henrietta.jpg" title="henrietta lacks">

Going in, I knew that *The Immortal Life Henrietta Lacks* would be a straightforward
biography of Henrietta Lacks, whose infinitely-reproducing cancer cells were taken
without consent and used for medical research, without any compensation to Henrietta
or her family. I knew that it would be an important and tragic story about race, class,
science, and medicine. What I didn't realize was that this book is written in a
beautiful inter-woven time-traveling style that masterfully jumps between three
narrative strands: the history of cancer research and medical ethics, the story of
Henrietta Lacks and her family in 1950s Baltimore, and the buddy-cop road trip tale
of Rebecca Skloot (the author) and Deborah Lacks (Henrietta's daughter). The beautiful
narrative combined with the unfathomably meticulous research&ndash;-Skloot was able to
recreate the exact conditions of the day Henrietta discovered her tumor in 1951,
down to the weather and color of the walls&ndash;-makes this a serious feat of journalism
and scientific writing.

The most important thing about this book, though, is that it's made Henrietta's
story an integral part of the science education curriculum. No lesson on cancer is
complete without a discussion of the fraught history of medical research and a serious
reflection on bioethics.

#### **4\. Will & Ariel Durant &ndash; The Lessons of History (1968)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/lessons_of_history.jpg" title="lessons of history">

Two historians reflect on a lifetime of studying the past. The lessons of 100
centuries distilled into 100 pages. Every paragraph is bursting with aphorisms,
many of which are dated, but all of which are insightful.

<!-- Some of my favorite quotes: -->

<!-- <blockquote>
Our worst vices might be remnants from out rise, rather than signs of our decline.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
An excess of order is order; an excess of liberty is chaos.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Shakespeare is immortal only between ice ages.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Economic history is the repeated cystoly and diastole of wealth accumulation by the
rich then redistribution, either peacefully or by revolution. The upper classes hissed,
sighed, then resumed concentrating wealth.
</blockquote> -->

One key takeaway lesson for me is that almost all modern-day problems and debates
have some analogue in the past. Wealth inequality, technological change, political
turmoil, populism, imperialism, colonialism, socialism, capitalism: none of these
are the least bit new. Be very, *very* skeptical any time anyone says anything is
"unprecedented." Chances are, they haven't looked hard enough into history, the
source of unbelievably more precedent than you can imagine.

A final point *The Lessons of History* makes excellently is that, aside from improvements
in the material conditions of life (health, nourishment, etc.), each successive
generation is better off because they have more of the lineage of human history
to reflect on. There is more art, music, science, history, and philosophy available
for consumption and contemplation today than ever before, and this is true of
every generation to follow.

Incidentally, Chance the Rapper makes the exact same point in a commencement address
he gave earlier this year.

James Brown was revolutionary, but he lacked for inspiration
something that we now have: the music of James Brown. Michael Jackson had James
Brown, but didn't have Michael Jackson. Beyoncé had Michael Jackson, but also
experienced the unthinkable: a childhood void of the music of Beyoncé. We get Beyoncé,
and can continue to build on top of this massive cultural legacy. I find that to
be pretty dang inspiring.

#### **5\. Atul Gawande &ndash; Being Mortal (2014)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/being_mortal.jpg" title="being mortal">

Our current approach to end-of-life care is whack. When a patient is diagnosed with
a terminal illness, many doctors try extend their life no matter the cost,
and often fail to take into account patients' wishes and priorities. Invasive surgeries,
unpleasant therapies, buckets of medication, life in a hospital with no friends or family,
and huge medical expenses are a routine part of end-of-life care. And even if
these procedures are successful, there's an information asymmetry at play. Terminally
ill patients think they're gaining decades of life; doctors know they're only being
spared months. This over-medicalization of death forgets that the end of life should
be dignified and meaningful, not isolating and dispiriting.

And paradoxically, this over-medicalization might not even be the most effective way to
extend life at all! When doctors themselves become terminally ill, they reject the standard
procedures, opting instead to live out their final days in comfort in hospice care,
rather than stuck in a hospital bed...and then end up living longer anyway!

In a world with an increasingly aging population, *Being Mortal* is an eye-opening,
must-read book.

#### **6\. Kate Manne &ndash; Down Girl (2017)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/down_girl.jpg" title="down girl">

This is a dense, technically rigorous, meticulously argued philosophical treatise
on misogyny. I learned a great deal. Manne argues that misogyny is not about men's
hatred of women, per se, but rather about the attitudes and societal structures
that keep women in a subservient position. Contrary to popular belief, men don't
seek to deprive women of their humanity or personhood. The logic of misogyny
is that women's humanity ought to be directed to the service of men.

There is a broader point here: when one group oppresses another, whether it be
in the context of patriarchy, slavery, or genocide, it is not because
they view the oppressed group as sub-human. You wouldn't be concerned if a sub-human
entity shamed, humiliated, or betrayed you, nor would you seek to objectify, punish,
or dominate them. As Manne says: "it's not a sense of a woman's humanity that is
lacking. Her humanity is precisely the problem."

For a brilliant summary, check out <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-root-of-all-cruelty"
target="_blank">this article from the psychologist Paul Bloom</a>, which is where I first
heard about the book. *Down Girl* is essential, especially for men, in order to understand
social forces that we can't see, and often unknowingly perpetuate.

#### **7\. David Kaiser &ndash; How The Hippies Saved Physics (2011)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/hippies.jpg" title="how the hippies saved physics">

After World War II, the US government, especially the Department of Defense made
huge investments in physics research, since physicists had played a huge role in
the war (see *The Making of the Atomic Bomb*!). Physicists were tasked with building
on the success (scientifically, not ethically speaking) of the bomb. In the late '60s
and early '70s, however, as the threat of the Cold War began to wane, this funding
and fervor subsided, leaving huge numbers of PhD students without job prospects. A
sizable chunk of these newly unemployed students did what many people were doing in
the late '60s and early '70s: moving to California and joining the counterculture revolution.
This is backdrop against *How The Hippies Saved Physics* is set.

The scientists who formalized quantum mechanics in the 1920s had to contend with
some weirdness in the theory: particles that remain mutually entangled even when
light-years away, experiments that appear to yield different results depending on
the presence of an observer, and superpositions of states (like Schrödinger's eponymous
cat, which was initially proposed to ridicule the idea of superposition). Though
there was initially debate over how to interpret these bizarre findings, the QM community
eventually settled on an approach known as "shut up and calculate"&ndash;-if the equations
work, who cares about the philosophical implications of superposition or entanglement?

The Fundamental Fysiks Group cared. This rag-tag band of scientist-hippies were as
passionate about faith healing, mind-reading, mysticism, and the occult as they were
about academic physics. They were concerned that an ESP gap with the Soviet Union
was as worrisome as a missile gap, and helped spur "remote viewing" experiments
at Stanford. They founded a seminar on quantum entanglement at the Essalen Institute,
which is better known for LSD, meditation, and yoga than for Hilbert spaces and
momentum operators. They argued that telekinesis was possible: if matter can alter
consciousness, consciousness should be able to alter matter. But they also took seriously
the idea of non-locality&ndash;-namely, that microscopic particles can act in concert
even when separated by huge distances (i.e. billions of light-years). Einstein dismissed
this idea as "spooky action at a distance," but it turns out to be true. It's kind
of hard to believe, but much of contemporary quantum information science, including quantum
computing, is only possible because of ideas that were discussed, debated, and
preserved by these people:

#### **8\. Steve Martin &ndash; Born Standing Up (2007)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/steve_martin.jpg" title="born standing up">

It's a dang shame that Steve Martin's early comedy is relegated to the archives
of stand-up history, because it's still unbelievably funny. Listen, in full, to
this song, from 1977. It feels absolutely timeless.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMAXuZOw_DY"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
allowfullscreen></iframe>

If *Born Standing Up* makes anything clear, it's that Steve Martin worked his
tuchus off to get to where he is. Becoming a successful comedian requires years
and years of toil without recognition, dozens of bombed shows, countless hours
of workshopping material, and a refusal to ever become complacent. Only then can
you craft one-liners like these:

<blockquote>New research suggests that more Americans watch television than any
other appliance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I’ve been your friend for a while, and I think I can ask you this
question: What time is it?</blockquote>

The book is read by Steve Martin himself, and hearing his old material in his own
voice is such a treat.

<hr>

At this point in the book-selection process, I became overwhelmed by the number of
good books I read this year and decided I couldn't possibly round out the top-10.
So I'll simply mention some more books I loved, without the daunting numbering
scheme.

#### **Will Durant &ndash; The Story of Philosophy (1924)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/philosophy.jpg" title="the story of philosophy">

The best summary I've ever read of the ideas of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, and
Bacon. Will Durant is a flippin' poet, and he has more delicious turns of phrase per page
than any other historian I've ever read. The descriptions of the more modern the philosophers
are a bit sketchier, but that's to be expected from a book written in 1924. But everything
up to the Enlightenment is unimpeachable and eloquent as heck.

#### **When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi (2016)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/kalanithi.jpg" title="when breath becomes air">

This joined *Being Mortal* in my "books about death" phase earlier this year (don't ask).
*When Breath Becomes Air* is the autobiography of Paul Kalanithi, an ultra-ambitious
and pretty brilliant neurosurgeon/neuroscientist who was diagnosed with lung cancer
near the end of his residency/postdoc at Stanford. The book is sad as hell, but
I loved it because it gave me a front-row seat to world I will never see from the inside:
dissecting a cadaver, operating on a hippocampus, telling a patient they will die. It
was also harrowing to see someone with such huge plans for his life grapple with the
fact that he'll never be able to achieve those goals. Hearing Paul Kalanithi work
through his end-of-life priorities makes you want to get your life goals into focus
right away. (And yet here I am, on a schedule of 10 minutes work, 4 hours music on repeat)

#### **Ta-Nehisi Coates &ndash; We Were Eight Years In Power**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/coates.jpg" title="we were eight years in power">

What I love most about Ta-Nehisi Coates is that his essays are always rooted in history.
Everything is tied back to the colonizing of the Americas, or the Revolutionary War, or the
Civil War, or Jim Crow, or redlining, or segregation. He expertly picks apart how racism
can manifest itself. Most interesting to me is how specific racist policies from the
past can lead to vastly unequal outcomes in the present, even if, hypothetically, there
were no present-day racists (which, to be sure, is preposterous). Even if you've read
all of Coates' Atlantic articles already, it's worth reading *We Were Eight Years in Power*
to see them all in a coherent narrative.

#### **Ashlee Vance &ndash; Elon Musk (2015)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/elon.jpg" title="elon musk">

Here's something I agree with Peter Thiel on: the last couple decades have seen
amazing advances in the world of bits (software, the internet, social media, AI),
but not nearly enough advance in the world of physical stuff. Say what you will
about Elon Musk: he's the only person ridiculous enough to make self-driving
and/or electric-powered cars a reality---both a huge boon for humans, like, being
alive more---and take the coolest thing our species does (space travel) to the
next level. Pretty freaking cool.

#### **Tina Fey &ndash; Bossypants (2011)**

<img class="book" src="{{ page.directory }}/bossypants.jpg" title="bossypants">

I re-read *Bossypants* as part of my "women comedians' memoirs" binge at the start
of 2018. Out of all of the ones I read---Amy Poehler's, Amy Schumer's, both of Mindy Kaling's,
Anna Kendrick's---Tina Fey's is by far the best. The narration is phenomenal and the
jokes are plentiful (as a warning in the preface: "I use all kinds of elitist words
like 'impervious' and 'gerund'").

#### **Waking Up With Sam Harris**

Still my favorite podcast, even though I find myself increasingly taking issue with
many of Sam's views. A couple of my favorite episodes were:

* Is #MeToo Going To Far (with Rebecca Traister)
  - Traister challenges and engages with Sam in a super productive way, and models how
  to be persuasive and assertive without a hint of contempt. Sam is also uncharacteristically
  charitable, which makes for a great discussion.
* Gary Taubes: The case against sugar
  - The most interesting thing I learned is that causal inference is unbelievably hard. Is it true
  that having a glass of wine with dinner is good for you, or do people with stable,
  happy, healthy lives have the luxury of enjoying a nightly glass of wine? Do placebos
  actually work as effectively as real medications, or do placebo studies simply show
  that the type of people who obey their doctor's orders and complete prescribed
  treatments in their entirety are more likely to become healthy? After all: neither
  the placebo nor the real medication work if they're not taken consistently.

#### **The Ezra Klein Show**

* The Green Pill with Dr. Melanie Joy
  - A harrowing conversation about the brutality of animal eating, or carnism, an
ideology as insidious and systemic as any other -ism out there. Get this: more animals
killed each day than the number of humans killed in all wars, *combined*. I don't
even know how to process a statistic like that.
* Anand Giridharadas on the elite charade of changing the world
  - This was an important one. Anand criticizes elites in the corporate world for
starting "philanthropic side-hustles" instead of confronting the harm they do in their
day jobs, and for existing in wealthy, lavish echo chambers.


#### **The Bill Simmons Podcast**
* How I keep up with American sports in an inconvenient time zone. I especially enjoyed
Bill's converstaions with Kevin Durant, and his debate with Juliet Litman on the
<a href="http://besttv.theringer.com/" target="_blank"> 100 greatest TV episodes of the century</a>

#### **Caliphate**
* A ten-episode series from New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi on how
ISIS recruited and radicalized a young Canadian man who has since returned from
Syria. We learn about how recruits educated in fundamentalist religious teachings
then trained to commit heinous acts of violence, including brutal beheadings. Rukmini's
own journalism consists of sneaking into ISIS-held buildings and searching for
documents, receipts, notepads, or any other paper trail that can be used to understand
the inner workings of the terrorist organization. The entire podcast series is
captivating and scary as hell. By the way: what even happened to ISIS? Is that, like,
not a thing anymore?

#### **Very Bad Wizards**
* I can't really pick a specific episode, but Dave Pizarro (a psychologist)
  and Tamler Sommers (a philosopher) strike the perfect hilarity-to-rigour ratio.

#### **Lexicon Valley**
* John McWhorter is a goddamn national treasure. He effortlessly weaves together
interesting stories about the English language while speaking in fluent musical theater
and old movie references.

#### **Conversations With Tyler**
* Tyler Cowen is probably the best question-asker out there, and these episodes are
worth listening to simply to marvel at Tyler's preparation for the interviews. He
reads everything his guest has ever written, from their current op-eds to their
undergraduate theses, and never misses a beat. It's an sight (sound) to behold (hear).

#### **San Francisco**

This year, I visited San Francisco for the first time, to participate in a pretty sweet
retreat called <a href="joininteract.com" target="_blank">Interact</a>. Here's a
<a href="https://twitter.com/mattyj612/status/1082863343956709376" target="_blank">Twitter
thread</a> where I kvell about the people I met there. In addition to Interact, I
visited the Stanford campus (gorgeous, holy hell) and the offices of Google, Apple,
and Khan Academy. I also met Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" target="_blank"> 3Blue1Brown</a>, probably the best explanatory
mathematical resource ever, and met some other ultra-impressive people while visiting
<a href="http://topos.house" target="_blank">houses</a> that have

A few months later, I return to San Francisco for yet another retreat, this time with
basically every Silicon Valley person I follow on Twitter convened in one place to talk
about improving the world 'n' stuff. It was fun and fascinating, but simultaneously kind
of alarming. The Silicon Valley ilk have a very well-defined lens on the world. They
think that they're thinking outside of the box, but they've really just all collectively
moved to a new techno-utopic-libertarian-optimistic box. That's not a bad thing,
per se, and I often enjoy being in that box myself, but it would be silly not to
acknowledge the homogenizing force of the Bay Area. More people probably need to
jump between Oxford (critical, slow-moving, big fan of institutions) and the
Bay Area (quick-paced, market-motivated, skeptical of institutions), to lean that
two bubbles of ultra-smart, ultra-driven people can have wildly different cultures
and lenses on the world. For what it's worth, I like both a great deal, and probably
like San Francisco more, but could never live in a place with such a well-defined
ethos for any extended period of time.

The most important thing, though, I took out of my trips to San Francisco was...

#### **Avalon**

#### **Programming in R**

I chose to use R for my thesis, which was a data science-heavy project on whether
tweets with moral and emotional language were more likely to be retweeted. (Here's
the project on the <a href="https://osf.io/cvw8s/" target="_blank">Open Science Framework.</a>
Go reproducibility!) I was lukewarm at first, but I have now absolutely fallen in
love with R, RStudio, the Tidyverse, and the incredible open source R community.
Using R feels like playing Tetris, and every time you insert a pipe operator `%>%`,
inserted with `cmd-shift-m`, you feel like you've just cleared five rows with a long
vertical piece. If you ever need to do anything with data, especially for social
science research, ditch whatever software you're using and head on over to R. If
you don't find it fun, let me know and I'll help you turn your R experience into a
blast and a half!

I learned two important lessons from my thesis. First: when learning to code---or
when learning any tricky skill, really---the most important thing is continuous feedback.
You should be constantly sharing your work, and if you're stuck for more than 10 minutes,
ask an expert for help. 9%% of the time, the thing you're stuck on is silly or a
strange matter of convention, and 90% of the time you'll figure out the answer before
your expert even has time to respond. My personal expert is my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing" target="_blank">David</a>, who is a data scientist and who was unbelievably generous
with his help. It allowed me to get up to speed in R super, super quickly.

The second lesson is that it's hella hard to improve at anything without a specific
problem to solve. If your goal is "I want to learn R," you won't find yourself making.
much progress. But if your goal is "I have two weeks to finish my thesis, which involves
a ton of data analysis," then you will find yourself learning R alarmingly fast.

#### **Evernote**

I've now moved all of my note-taking and information storage to Evernote, and
it's phenomenal. Whenever I watch a good YouTube video, read a good article,
or hear a good podcast episode, I immediately save it to Evernote. I also take
notes there while I listen to audiobooks. This ultra-long post would not have
been possible if I hadn't been continuously saving interesting stuff on Evernote.
I also use it as a note-taking device for my thesis research, instead of clunky ol'
Word documents.

#### **Edinburgh Fringe Festival**

#### **Veganism**

#### **Emailing Your Heroes**
