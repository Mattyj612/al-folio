figured anything out. I am currently designing and teaching two courses at McMaster University:
an introduction to the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ncz7ULFcX3zASSr4GufMVg6jx-xnQLzNQpwmdMtZeB8/edit" target="_blank">history of science</a>,
and an overview of the social issues surrounding
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxDhD2yixAGMfLhbd6ncGF1gFJAenRT3AXqiu91wVo4/edit" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.
I've done research on <a href="https://osf.io/cvw8s/" target="_blank">moral
psychology on Twitter</a>, and worked with NYU's <a href="https://www.labdevelopingmind.com" target="_blank">
Lab for the Developing Mind</a> to study the nature of geometric intutions. I am
currently producing a podcast on the making of the atomic bomb. I spend the rest of my
time doing improv comedy, zooming through audiobooks, watching basketball, and playing (quite poor) chess.
