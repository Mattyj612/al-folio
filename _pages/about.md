I study the history and science of thought, to understand how the heck anyone ever
figured anything out. I am currently designing and teaching two courses at McMaster University:
an introduction to the history of science, and an overview of the social issues surrounding
artificial intelligence. I've done research on <a href="https://osf.io/cvw8s/" target="_blank">moral
psychology on Twitter</a>, and worked with NYU's <a href="https://www.labdevelopingmind.com" target="_blank">
Lab for the Developing Mind</a> to study the nature of geometric intutions. I am
also producing a 10-episode podcast on the making of the atomic bomb. I spend the rest of my
time doing improv comedy, zooming through audiobooks, watching basketball, and playing (quite poor) chess.
